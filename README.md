## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.quackit.com/css/css_color_codes.cfm

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 

	There wasn't much challenge in creating this submission. The pre-work documentation was very thorough on what to do, and provided many external links to help as well. I looked up css color codes online to help with choosing the colors and that was about it for outside help. I already have expierience with Github, md files, and gif creation due to previous classes I have taken which did very similar projects to the pre-work with similar submissions. I doubt I would have had any issues if the pre-work was more difficult though, as I trust in my ability to quickly learn new skills and solve problems by searching online for answers to any questions I may have.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 

	After what I've seen, I'm more curious about certain web applications I've seen like dynamically editing a site, such as wikipedia allowing you to edit the page as a user. Procedurally generated websites or infinite scrollers are also a curiosity as well in how they are made.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 

	To make the site more interactive for potential viewers, ideally there should be a total of 9 buttons, numbers or images of shapes on the button to differentiate them better, make the game endless, and add a leaderboard that keeps track of the scores of each player.
